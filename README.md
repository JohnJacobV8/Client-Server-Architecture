# Client-Server Architecture

As part of my certification in **Fundamentals of Programming and Software Engineering at Platzi**, I studied the client-server architecture, one of the invisible but essential pillars that make the internet work.

Every time you type a web address like *platzi.com* and hit Enter, your browser becomes the client that sends a request, and the server hosting the site responds with the information you need. Between them, a constant dialogue takes place, mediated by protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS, which also ensures that data travels encrypted for greater security.

Behind this seemingly simple interaction, much more happens than we see. The browser sends information about your device and operating system, allowing the server to adapt the content so you can view it properly on mobile or desktop. Cookies stored on your device help the server recognize you and personalize your experience, such as when Gmail remembers your session and shows you your inbox directly.

When a web page loads, it does not arrive all at once. First, the server sends the HTML, which defines the basic structure. Then CSS files are downloaded to shape the visual design, followed by JavaScript scripts that enable interactivity. The browser assembles everything piece by piece until the final result is displayed.

In this information exchange, there are two main ways to send data: the **GET method** and the **POST method**. With GET, parameters are visible in the URL, such as when you perform a search and see your query in the browser‚Äôs address bar. With POST, the information is sent hidden within the request, making it the appropriate method for sensitive data such as passwords. Servers also respond with status codes that indicate the result of each request: 200 for success, 404 when a resource does not exist, 500 if an internal error occurs, or 300 when the address has changed.

This model is not limited to web pages. Email, for example, uses protocols such as **SMTP**, **POP3**, or **IMAP**. Mobile applications also work under this scheme, although instead of HTML and CSS, they exchange data in formats like **JSON** or **XML** through native languages such as Java, Kotlin, or Swift. In all cases, the logic remains the same: a client makes a request and a server processes it to return a response.

The client-server architecture is the backbone of our digital experience. Without it, the web as we know it, emails, and the apps we use daily would not exist. Understanding its functioning allows us to better appreciate how millions of devices connect, share information, and make the digital world operate in milliseconds.

## Conclusion

The client-server architecture is the foundation of modern connectivity. It provides **order and direction** to global communication, making it possible for messages, data, and services to travel from one point to another on the planet in just milliseconds.
